            # Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) Ordination Function
##  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ##
# Code written by Nick Lyon
  ## Updated 2018, April 2

# This function performs a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination for you

# Colors are colorblind safe and found here:
  # http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=GnBu&n=4

# Required libraries
#install.packages(c("vegan", "geomorph")) # delete the first hashtag and this line will install the packages
library(vegan) # Need this library for NMS
  ## It's also included within the function, but better safe than sorry
library(geomorph) # Need this library for analysis

# START ####

# Clear the environment so the function doesn't catch on something strange and user-specific
rm(list = ls())

# Also, set your working directory to the location where your project is (and delete my WD code here)
setwd("~/Documents/School/Misc R/Custom Functions")
  ## "Session" menu at top of screen -> "Set Working Directory" -> "To Project Directory"

# Let's use some of the data from the vegan package to demonstrate the function
data("varespec")
resp <- varespec
  ## Data on lichen "pastures", can check it out with: 
?varespec

# We do need a group column though for this ordination function
factor <- as.vector(c(rep.int("Trt1", (nrow(resp)/4)),
                      rep.int("Trt2", (nrow(resp)/4)),
                      rep.int("Trt3", (nrow(resp)/4)),
                      rep.int("Trt4", (nrow(resp)/4))) )
ref <- cbind(factor, as.data.frame(resp))

# Analysis #### 

# ANALYSIS NOTE:
  ## While NMS can be useful in visualizing multivariate differences, it is NOT an analytical tool!
  ## Use of an actual multivariate analytical test is necessary if differences among groups are of interest
  ## Feel free to skip through this section if you don't need/want help with multivariate analysis

# Initial perMANOVA
procD.lm(resp ~ factor, data = ref)
  ## Interpretation: at least one group is significantly different from the others
  ## Yes these groups don't mean anything, but it's still illustrative.

# Want to know *which* groups were different from the others
advanced.procD.lm(resp ~ factor, ~ 1, ~ factor, data = ref)
  ## syntax is (Y ~ x, ~ null hypothesis, ~ grouping variable for pairwise comparisons, data = data)

# Significance groups (different letter means significantly different)
# Trt1 = A | Trt2 = A | Trt3 = A | Trt4 = B
  # Only treatment 4 was different from all others

# NMS ####

# Run the model
mds <- metaMDS(resp, autotransform = F, expand = F, k = 2, try = 100)
  ## Where "resp" is the matrix of your community data (without grouping variables)

mds$stress
  ##  "Stress" is typically reported parenthetically for NMS ordinations,
  ## Similar to F statistics or p values
  ## Clarke et al 1993 suggests stress â‰¤ 0.15 to be a good threshold/rule of thumb

# Actual function (only works for four groups, but that is easily modified by you)
