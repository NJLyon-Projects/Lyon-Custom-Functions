# NEW PACKAGE

I have a true R package that can be downloaded from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/NJLyon-Projects/helpR) that contains all of these functions. Use that instead!

## This repository's purpose

This repository was where I first started writing my own functions and preserved my iterative (and often incremental) progress. Now that I have a "real" package to host these functions I may only preserve this repository for posterity or I might develop future functions here before migrating finished products into the package. Regardless, use the actual package variants as they are most likely to be up to date and have formalized documentation above and beyond what I have included as comments in these scripts.
